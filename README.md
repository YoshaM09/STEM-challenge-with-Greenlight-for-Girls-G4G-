# STEM-challenge-with-Greenlight-for-Girls-G4G

### Purpose: 
To create an impact and inspire young children to pursue STEM subjects.

### Approach:

Submitted community initiative outline and plan.
Contacted the nearby libraries to get permission for placing the bookmark flashcards in the books and asking children for feedback when they return the borrowed books.
Created the bookmark flashcards, each containing an explanation about a topic related to STEM and placed them in the books and at the checkout kiosk in the county library.
Submitted the final presentation reporting on how the impact activity went based on the feedback received from the library.
### Impact: 

I was able to encourage teenagers to pursue STEM fields by being introduced to some of the STEM principles and concepts through creation of bookmark flashcards.
